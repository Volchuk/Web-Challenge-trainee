Server side language I use:
Java via Java Server Pages
I'm using JSP because it's convenient built on my previous
experience and knowledge and logically extends studying Java.

What do I know about PHP:
Widespread script language for creating dynamic web-pages, web-applications.

Unfortunately I don't have solid experience with PHP.
I have worked with Joomla and WordPress.
